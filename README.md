# generic-template
Template for any repo with all our usual files. Language doesn't matter.

If you need a .gitignore file, I recommend generating it with Toptal's [.gitignore tool](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore). For example, [here](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/visualstudiocode,node) is one generated for VSCode and NodeJS.
